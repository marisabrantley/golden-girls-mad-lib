# The Golden Girls Mad Lib

This project was based on a Golden Girls Mad Libs book I had received as a gift. It features the game, "Blanche's Southern Fried Sayings." I wanted to share it with a friend, a fellow Golden Girls fan, and thought this would be a fun and creative way for her - and others - to enjoy it!

## Objective

This responsive Mad Libs game was created with an HTML form, action and method attributes, label and input elements, and vanilla JavaScript.

**How to Play:**

* **Step 1:** Fill out each field on the form. (Please note, all fields are required.)

* **Step 2:** When finished filling out the fields, click the button below.

* **Step 3:** Read Blanche's Southern Fried Sayings that you've created and have a laugh.
